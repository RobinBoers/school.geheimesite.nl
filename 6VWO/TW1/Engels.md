## Désirée's Baby

### Plot summary

- Désirée is found as a toddler.
- Armands mother dies when he is 8.
- Armand falls in Love with Désirée and marries her.
- They get a baby together.
- Armand "softens" with respect to his behaviour to slaves.
- At 3 mo. old the baby "turns black".
- Armand starts acting mean towards Désirée.
- Désirée is confused at first, but when she (quite late) finds out, she's shocked.
- Désirée writes a letter to her "mom", who replies she can come back (with the baby).
- Armand doesn't want her anymore, and encourages her to leave.
- Désirée leaves. She doesn't go home, suicide is hinted. What happens to her, we don't know.
- Armand burns all Désirée's and the baby's stuff on a Bonfire.
- Armand finds out his mother was black from a letter she wrote to his dad.
- Thus he was the non-white parent that "turned the baby black".

### Characters

- **Madame Valmondé:** adoption mother of Désirée (from toddler age), couldn't have children herself. Sees Désirée as a gift from God.

- **Désirée:** orphan, "desperately" in love with Armand, very shocked when she finds out (quite late) the child isn't (fully) white. When she gets accused of being non-white, she's in denial about it. Her true heritage is never confirmed.

- **Old Aubigny**: father of Armand, easy-going, not very strict for his slaves.

- **Armand Aubigny**: passionate, high social status, indifferent about social status initially. Inherited the plantation L'Abri, rules it with a iron fist. The baby makes him very happy (partially because it's a boy), and he changes his attitude (he becomes more kind, "softended"). When he finds out the baby isn't (fully) white, he "hardens" and starts acting mean towards Désirée (he doesn't love her anymore because she hurt him).

- **Zandrine**: maid at L'Abri, takes care of the baby.

- **La Blanche**: slave from the plantation, with multiple sons, who was hinted to have a sexual relationship with Armand (because her son it partly white). Has a lighter skin tone than the rest of the slaves.

- **Mother of Armand**: a black woman, died when Armand was 8. (How the fuck do you not remember what your mother looked like when you were 8??)

### Themes

- **Racism:** the behaviour of Armand, regarding his shifted attitude with respect to his wife and son, given the fact his son is non-white, as well as his treatment of his slaves, and the precense of slavery in the story in general.
- **Denial:** Désirée is in denial about the potential possibility of being non-white. Armand denies his wife and son the love they need.
- **Indifference**: Armand is initially indifferent about the social status-gap between him and Désirée. Armand is also indifferent about her leaving.
- **Love:** unconditional love between Désirée and Madame Valmondé. Armond is passionately in love with Désirée. She lights up his world. Désirée, in turn, is also "desperately" in love with Armand. Armand's love, however is conditional, because it disappears when he finds out his son is not (fully) white.
- **Blindness:** Désirée, initially, doesn't see that her son is non-white, and finds out much later than the other characters.
- **Irony:** the situational irony, that Armand is actually the non-white person in question, when the audience expected Désirée to be, given her unknown heritage.

### Symbols

- **Stone pillar:** represents Désirée's unknown heritage.
- **Fine clothes:** represents the wealth of the Aubigny family, and in turn, slavery.
- **L'Abri:** the plantation represents tradegy, despair; it's not a place you'd want to be: people get treated awfully, the place is "sad-looking", there's unresolved feelings.
- **Bonfire:** represents Armand's attempt to "purify" himself, to forget Désirée; a cleansing. It also leads to him finding the letters his mother wrote.

### Characters

- **Victor Frankenstein:** ...

- **The creature** (nameless): created by Frankenstein. Superhuman. Exiled and rejected. Initially, in a lot of ways like a baby or alien; doesn't know how to read emotions, doesn't know language. Admires humans and wants to be like them, and wants approval and validation<!-- (actually, that sounds more like a teenager LOL)-->. In his head, he develops a (parasocial) relationship with the cottagers (calling them "friends", "protectors", and "his"). He adores and almost worships them. After getting repeatedly rejected, he turns evil.

- **De Lacy:** old blind man. Lives in the cottage with his children, Felix and Agatha. Is very respected by the them, and plays the guitar a lot.

- **Felix:** young man that lives in the cottage. Works somewhere else during the day. In the beginning of the story he is very sad, but he becomes happy once Safie arrives.

- **Agatha:** we don't know a lot about her, but she seems very caring and thoughtful.

- **Safie:** Felix's girlfriend. Married away? (Suggested, because she had "different feelings" when arriving at the cottage, and didn't speak the language initially). Can sing very beautifully; not sure of the significance.

- **William Frankenstein**: the little brother of Frankenstein. Gets murdered by the creature.

- **Dr. Frankenstein (Sr.):** father of Frankenstein. A renowned Syndic (aka works in the government).

### Intertextuality

- From *Ruins of Empires*, the creature learns history, government, religion, nations and society. It also confuses him, because he cannot understand how man can be both beautiful and powerful, as well as cruel.

- From *Sorrows of Werter*, it learns about domestic life, death and darker emotions. It also made him <del>further question himself and the reason for his existence</del> <ins>have an existential crisis</ins>.

- From *Plutarch*, it learns more about society and the importance of perspective and education (the law-givers vs soldiers argument).

- From *Paradise Lost*, the creature learns about religion and spirituality. It however, takes the story as a "true history", rather than fiction. It compares himself to both Adam (being created from nothing and having nothing) and Satan (being neglected and despised).

### Criticisms of society

- Why are people cruel? Why murder?
- Why inequality in wealth and status? Why property and money so important?

### Themes

- **(Power of) Knowledge:** the creature's appearance in mirror starts its self-doubt and self-hate. *Ruins of Empires* makes him question himself, since he does not have *anything* (wealth, status, friends), so what *is* he in society? The only thing he has is a horrifying body. Reading *Sorrows of Werter*, he contemplates the significance of his existance (would anyone miss him if he wouldn't exist?), and *Paradise Lost* further solidified his position of an outcast.

- **Solitude and rejection:** the creature is alone and isolated, because he is *literally* one-of-a-kind. Furthermore, he gets rejected by everyone and thus lives in complete isolation.

- **Corruption**: the creature has a well-functioning moral compass throughout the story and is able to empathise with humans. However, as the story progresses, he repeatedly gets rejected and hurt by humans. This turns him evil; leading to revenge.

- **Revenge:** the creature takes revenge (for being emotionally hurt) in three ways: <small>1)</small> burning the cottage down, <small>2)</small> murdering Frankenstein's brother, <small>3)</small> framing the babysitter for it.

- **Prejudice:** throughout the story, characters judge and villainize the creature because of his appearance, with complete disregard for his personality or feelings.

- **Romanticism:** ...

- **Seasons:** the first change represents the arrival of Safie, and for the creature, the mastering of language. Autumn represents the failed attempt to befriend the cottagers. Spring, then, represents new beginnings, and hope for the future (which is quickly crushed tho).

- **Irony:** the cottagers name the "invisible hand" that helps them a "*good spirit*", while in reality, the creature resembles more of the devil. Also, De Lacy says it would be a "true pleasure to be in any way serviceable to a *human creature*".
