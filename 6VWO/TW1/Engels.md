- Désirée writes a letter to her "mom", who replies she can come back (with the baby).

- Armand finds out his mother was black.
- Thus he was the non-white parent that "turned the baby black".

### Characters

- **Madame Valmondé:** adoption mother of Désirée (from toddler age), couldn't have children herself. Sees Désirée as a gift from God.

- **Désirée:** orphan, "desperately" in love with Armand, very shocked when she finds out (quite late) the child isn't (fully) white. When she gets accused of being non-white, she's in denial about it. Her true heritage is never confirmed.

- **Old Aubigny**: father of Armand, easy-going, not very strict for his slaves.

- **Armand Aubigny**: passionate, high social status, indifferent about social status initially. Inherited the plantation L'Abri, rules it with a iron fist. The baby makes him very happy (partially because it's a boy), and he changes his attitude (he becomes more kind, "softended"). When he finds out the Baby isn't (fully) white, he "hardens" and starts acting mean towards Désirée (he doesn't love her anymore because she hurt him).

- **Zandrine**: maid at L'Abri, takes care of the baby.

- **La Blanche**: slave from the plantation, with multiple sons, who was hinted to have a sexual relationship with Armand (because her son it partly white). Has a lighter skin tone than the rest of the slaves.

- **Mother of Armand**: a black woman, died when Armand was 8. (How the fuck do you not remember what your mother looked like when you were 8??)

### Themes

- **Racism:** the behaviour of Armand, regarding his shifted attitude with respect to his wife and son, given the fact his son is non-white, as well as his treatment of his slaves, and the precense of slavery in the story in general.
- **Denial:** Désirée is in denial about the potential possibility of being non-white. Armand denies his wife and son the love they need.
- **Indifference**: Armand is initially indifferent about the social status-gap between him and Désirée. Armand is also indifferent about her leaving.
- **Love:** unconditional love between Désirée and Madame Valmondé. Armond is passionately in love with Désirée. She lights up his world. Désirée, in turn, is also "desperately" in love with Armand. Armand's love, however is conditional, because it disappears when he finds out his son is not (fully) white.
- **Blindness:** Désirée, initially, doesn't see that her son is non-white, and finds out much later than the other characters.
- **Irony:** the situational irony, that Armand is actually the non-white person in question, when the audience expected Désirée to be, given her unknown heritage.

### Symbols

- **Stone pillar**: represents Désirée's unknown heritage.
- **Fine clothes**: represents the wealth of the Aubigny family, and in turn, slavery.
- **L'Abri**: the plantation represents tradegy, despair; it's not a place you'd want to be: people get treated awfully, the place is "sad-looking", there's unresolved feelings.
- **Bonfire**: represents Armand's attempt to "purify" himself, to forget Désirée; a cleansing. It also leads to him finding the letters his mother wrote.
