## Désirée's Baby

### Plot summary

- Désirée is found as a toddler.
- Armands mother dies when he is 8.
- Armand falls in Love with Désirée and marries her.
- They get a baby together.
- Armand "softens" with respect to his behaviour to slaves.
- At 3 mo. old the baby "turns black".
- Armand starts acting mean towards Désirée.
- Désirée is confused at first, but when she (quite late) finds out, she's shocked.
- Désirée writes a letter to her "mom", who replies she can come back (with the baby).
- Armand doesn't want her anymore, and encourages her to leave.
- Désirée leaves. She doesn't go home, suicide is hinted. What happens to her, we don't know.
- Armand burns all Désirée's and the baby's stuff in a Bonfire.
- Armand finds out his mother was black from a letter she wrote to his dad.
- Thus he was the non-white parent that "turned the baby black".

### Characters

- **Madame Valmondé:** adoption mother of Désirée (from toddler age), couldn't have children herself. Sees Désirée as a gift from God.

- **Désirée:** orphan, "desperately" in love with Armand, very shocked when she finds out (quite late) the child isn't (fully) white. When she gets accused of being non-white, she's in denial about it. Her true heritage is never confirmed.

- **Old Aubigny**: father of Armand, easy-going, not very strict for his slaves.

- **Armand Aubigny**: passionate, high social status, indifferent about social status initially. Inherited the plantation L'Abri, rules it with a iron fist. The baby makes him very happy (partially because it's a boy), and he changes his attitude (he becomes more kind, "softended"). When he finds out the baby isn't (fully) white, he "hardens" and starts acting mean towards Désirée (he doesn't love her anymore because she hurt him).

- **Zandrine**: maid at L'Abri, takes care of the baby.

- **La Blanche**: slave from the plantation, with multiple sons, who was hinted to have a sexual relationship with Armand (because her son it partly white). Has a lighter skin tone than the rest of the slaves.

- **Mother of Armand**: a black woman, died when Armand was 8. (How the fuck do you not remember what your mother looked like when you were 8??)

### Themes

- **Racism:** the behaviour of Armand, regarding his shifted attitude with respect to his wife and son, given the fact his son is non-white, as well as his treatment of his slaves, and the precense of slavery in the story in general.
- **Denial:** Désirée is in denial about the potential possibility of being non-white. Armand denies his wife and son the love they need.
- **Indifference**: Armand is initially indifferent about the social status-gap between him and Désirée. Armand is also indifferent about her leaving.
- **Love:** unconditional love between Désirée and Madame Valmondé. Armond is passionately in love with Désirée. She lights up his world. Désirée, in turn, is also "desperately" in love with Armand. Armand's love, however is conditional, because it disappears when he finds out his son is not (fully) white.
- **Blindness:** Désirée, initially, doesn't see that her son is non-white, and finds out much later than the other characters.
- **Irony:** the situational irony, that Armand is actually the non-white person in question, when the audience expected Désirée to be, given her unknown heritage.

### Symbols

- **Stone pillar:** represents Désirée's unknown heritage.
- **Fine clothes:** represents the wealth of the Aubigny family, and in turn, slavery.
- **L'Abri:** the plantation represents tradegy, despair; it's not a place you'd want to be: people get treated awfully, the place is "sad-looking", there's unresolved feelings.
- **Bonfire:** represents Armand's attempt to "purify" himself, to forget Désirée; a cleansing. It also leads to him finding the letters his mother wrote.

### Discussion questions

- **Do you think Desiree would be okay with being part black if it did not mean that Armand would end the relationship?** I think she would not be okay with it. To understand this, we need to look at her reaction when she figures out the baby is non-white. "the blood turned like ice in her veins", "she stayed motionless, with rave riveted upon her child, and her face the picture of fright". When accused of being non-white, she "laughed hysterically" and "sent a despairing letter" to her adoption mother. From her reaction and following behaviour, we can conclude that being part black scares her. This takes place before Armand ends their relationship for good, so that cannot already have been on her mind. Maybe if she would have grown up in a more accepting environment, she would not have minded, but in the environment she is in, being black scares her. Therefore, I conclude she would not be okay with it.

- **In what way is Madame Valmondé an atypical character in this story?** Madame Valmondé is an atypical character because of her unconditional love for Désirée. Where other characters turn away in disgust when they find out Désirée is supposedly non-white, her mother fully accepts her, writing "My own Désirée: Come home to Valmondé; back to your mother who loves you. Come with your child." This is even more suprising, given Désirée is not her own child, but adopted. Many characters from the same period would have disowned or sent away Désirée, as Armand did. However, Madame Valmondé did none of that. Instead, she unconditionally loves Désirée, despite potential race "issues", and that makes her atypical for the time period the story is set in.

- **Did Armand Aubigny know about his heritage all along?** I think Armand did not know. Had he known, he might still have accused her for being part black as a method of cleansing his own reputation, in a way covering up his own heritage. However, in the story, we read he stopped loving her for the "unconscious shame she brought upon his home and his name." This suggests he does actually sincerly believe Désirée is the cause of the baby being non-white, because he is emotionally impacted by it. Therefore, I think he did not know about his own heritage before reading the letter at the end of the story.

- **There are some hints in the story that point to the ending. What are these points?** "She scanned the baby narrowly, and then loocked searchingly ad Zadrine. 'Yes, the baby has grown; has changed.'", "Look at my hand, whiter than your, Armand."

- **Who is La Blanche and how is she important to the story?** La Blanche is a black slave at L'Abri, who is hinted to have had a sexual relationship with Armand. She is a relevant character because her son being a quadroon implies Armand is partially black (\\(\frac{1}{2} \cdot \frac{1}{2} = \frac{1}{4}\\)).

- **How is racial prejudice or black inferiority represented in the story?** Racial prejudice and black inferiority is represented in the story in multiple ways. First off, the precense of slavery in the story. There is a clear social class difference and power imbalance between slaves and their masters. Furthermore, the visitors looking at the baby like some sort of "curiousity" and the rumours are also clear indicators of the sentiment at the time. Lastly, Armand rejecting Désirée and their son is also clearly a sign of racial prejudice.

### Characters

- **Victor Frankenstein:** ...

- **The creature** (nameless): created by Frankenstein. Superhuman. Exiled and rejected. Initially, in a lot of ways like a baby or alien; doesn't know how to read emotions, doesn't know language. Admires humans and wants to be like them, and wants approval and validation<!-- (actually, that sounds more like a teenager LOL)-->. In his head, he develops a (parasocial) relationship with the cottagers (calling them "friends", "protectors", and "his"). He adores and almost worships them. After getting repeatedly rejected, he turns evil.

- **De Lacy:** old blind man. Lives in the cottage with his children, Felix and Agatha. Is very respected by the them, and plays the guitar a lot.

- **Felix:** young man that lives in the cottage. Works somewhere else during the day. In the beginning of the story he is very sad, but he becomes happy once Safie arrives.

- **Agatha:** we don't know a lot about her, but she seems very caring and thoughtful.

- **Safie:** Felix's girlfriend. Married away? (Suggested, because she had "different feelings" when arriving at the cottage, and didn't speak the language initially). Can sing very beautifully; not sure of the significance.

- **William Frankenstein**: the little brother of Frankenstein. Gets murdered by the creature.

- **Dr. Frankenstein (Sr.):** father of Frankenstein. A renowned Syndic (aka works in the government).

### Intertextuality

- From _Ruins of Empires_, the creature learns history, government, religion, nations and society. It also confuses him, because he cannot understand how man can be both beautiful and powerful, as well as cruel.

- From _Sorrows of Werter_, it learns about domestic life, death and darker emotions. It also made him <del>further question himself and the reason for his existence</del> <ins>have an existential crisis</ins>.

- From _Plutarch_, it learns more about society and the importance of perspective and education (the law-givers vs soldiers argument).

- From _Paradise Lost_, the creature learns about religion and spirituality. It however, takes the story as a "true history", rather than fiction. It compares himself to both Adam (being created from nothing and having nothing) and Satan (being neglected and despised).

### Criticisms of society

- Why are people cruel? Why murder?
- Why inequality in wealth and status? Why property and money so important?

### Themes

- **(Power of) Knowledge:** the creature's appearance in mirror starts its self-doubt and self-hate. _Ruins of Empires_ makes him question himself, since he does not have _anything_ (wealth, status, friends), so what _is_ he in society? The only thing he has is a horrifying body. Reading _Sorrows of Werter_, he contemplates the significance of his existance (would anyone miss him if he wouldn't exist?), and _Paradise Lost_ further solidified his position of an outcast.

- **Solitude and rejection:** the creature is alone and isolated, because he is _literally_ one-of-a-kind. Furthermore, he gets rejected by everyone and thus lives in complete isolation.

- **Corruption** (or **Lost innocence**): the creature has a well-functioning moral compass throughout the story and is able to empathise with humans. However, as the story progresses, he repeatedly gets rejected and hurt by humans. This turns him evil; leading to revenge.

- **Revenge:** the creature takes revenge (for being emotionally hurt) in three ways: <small>1)</small> burning the cottage down, <small>2)</small> murdering Frankenstein's brother, <small>3)</small> framing the babysitter for it.

- **Prejudice:** throughout the story, characters judge and villainize the creature because of his appearance, with complete disregard for his personality or feelings.

- **Romanticism:** ...

- **Irony:** the cottagers name the "invisible hand" that helps them a "_good spirit_", while in reality, the creature resembles more of the devil. Also, De Lacy says it would be a "true pleasure to be in any way serviceable to a _human creature_".

### Symbols

- **De Lacy:** the old man represents prejudice, because he cannot see, and thus not judge the creature by, its appearance. Exemplified by the line "there is something in your words that persuades me that you are sincere".

- **Light:** represents birth/creation, discovery and purity. In other places it represents danger, as the creature cannot be seen at day (because humans are mean and pitchforks are sharp).

- **Knowledge:** as creature learns about the world, his "sorrow only increased with the knowledge". It further isolates him and solidifies his position as an outcast. "Of what a strange nature is knowledge! It clings to the mind, when it has once seized on it, like a lichen on the rock." Paradise is being blissfully ignorant; the cursed apple of knowledge casts you out.

- **Fire:** represents the duality of creation and destruction. Fire provides light, but it also burns. It can be seen as a metaphor for the creature, who can be both empathic, "benevolent and good", as well as vengeful and violent. Furthermore, fire can also represent the double-edged nature of knowledge.

- **Ice:** the artic (where the entire story is set) represents isolation, desolation, and (emotional) coldness.

- **The creature:** represents careless science; doing before thinking about the consequences. Once created, the creature terrifies Frankenstein, and (while not inherently evil) it turns violent due to his lack of responsibility, neglect and abandonment by its creator. The creature can also represent marginalised and dehumanized groups in society, and how they are treated.

- **Nature:** vividly described (an example of Romantic elements) in the story, and mirrors the emotions of the characters.

- **Seasons:** the first change represents the arrival of Safie, and for the creature, the mastering of language. Autumn represents the failed attempt to befriend the cottagers. Spring, then, represents new beginnings, and hope for the future (which is quickly crushed tho).

### Discussion questions

- **What is the role of knowledge in Frankenstein?** In Frankenstein, knowledge is .... Once learned, knowledge cannot be easily, unlearned, as noted by the creature in the line "Of what a strange nature is knowledge! It clings to the mind, when it has once seized on it, like a lichen on the rock." Knowledge of society, history, government, family and birth only further and further solidify his position as an outcast. One can conclude that paradise is being blissfully ignorant; the cursed apple of knowledge casts you out.

- **What is needed to be happy according to the creature?** According to the creature, emotional connection is a requirement for happiness. For most of the story, his wish is introducing himself to the cottagers and getting acquinted with them. After getting repeatedly rejected by humans, he turns to Frankenstein with the request of making him a fellow-creature. His suffering is caused by his solitude and lack of connection. His biggest desire is thus being accepted by others; to fit in and be seen.

## Brave New World

### Plot summary

- Educational tour through the Hatchery, students get an explanation of birth, human conditioning and the caste system.
- Fanny and Lenina discuss relationships ("everyone belongs to everyone"). Meanwhile Bernard angrily overhears a conversation between Henry and another guy about "having" Lenina.
- Mond explains the of origins of the New World State: strong emotions undermine social stability, so the New World State ensures its citizens stay in line using <small>1)</small> drugs, <small>2)</small> free sex, <small>3)</small> social conditioning to make them _enjoy_ their miserable lifes.
- Bernard participates in Solitairy Service (orgy porgy), but it doesn't make him feel anything. This makes him feel like an outcast.
- Bernard visits Helmholtz and they express their frustration with the World State. Bernard pities himself for his physique. Helmholtz however, is dissatisfied with the World State because he feels intellectually bored.
- Bernard goes on a date with Lenina and attempts "deep talk" about freedom and individuality, but she is _not_ having it.
- Bernard asks the Director for permission to take Lenina to Mailpais ("bad lands" in Spanish). The Director (accidentally) tells Bernard about the time _he himself_ went there and lost Linda in a storm.
- Bernard and Lenina meet John and Linda in the Reservation, and decide to take them to London.
- The Director exile Bernard to an island for being an "enemy of Society", but Bernard counters by showing them John and Linda.
- John becomes very famous. Bernard becomes very popular by association, and guards John like some kind of trophy. John feels used, and refuses to show up to one of Bernards parties, causing Bernard to lose all his new-gained social status.
- Lenina and John go to the "feelies" together; John hates it. Afterwards, they confess they're feelings to eachother, and John has a hard time making a grand gesture in a society where everything is _convient_. Lenina tries to seduce him, but John gets very mad because it reminds him of his mother, which he disapproves of.
- Linda dies, and John starts a riot at the Hospital for the Dying. Bernard and Helmholtz try to help him; they all get arrested.

- A paparatzi-filmmaker captures it and turns it into a "feely", causing a media storm around the lighthouse.
- Lenina comes to the lighthouse and gets assaulted by John.
- John hangs himself.

### World building

- Caste system: Alpha, Beta, Gamma, Delta, Epsilon. Each caste being dumbded down to perform their "inescapable social destiny".
- History, knowledge, and art are forbidden, because they would empower citizens to rise up against the World State, and thus undermine social stability.
- Any strong emotions or feelings are drowned out by a constant stream of entertainment and soma. Furthermore, Solitairy Service is there to make sure no-one steps out of line. Emotions are bad; they undermine social stability. Don't you _want_ to be happy, _always_?
- Relationships and family would cause instability, thus they are forbidden. Everyone belongs to everyone, and humans are (mass) produced in factories. Human childbirth is considered a taboo.
- Society is centered around consumption. Citizens are encouraged to buy new products instead of repairing broken things. Every free moment is filled up by entertainment, but great care is taken to make sure this entertainment requires as much materials and accessories as possible. Humans themselves are mass-produced and thought of as disposable and replaceble. Mere cogs in the machine that is Society.
- In the World State, no-one ages, because aging would emphasise the past, and history is forbidden. Citizens are conditioned to be indifferent of death. One day, they suddenly die, and no-one around them is even bothered about it.
- There cannot be progression or science, because progress would imply the present is not already perfected. Technology was needed to establish the World State, but is also a major threat to its continued existance. Science is the search for truth, which undermines the State's control. Therefore, science cannot exist.
- The totalitarian State is not enforced through violence, but rather through social conditioning and indoctrination. Outcasts are exiled to islands, where they live together with other outcasts, but cannot hurt the social order of the mainland.
- In Brave New World, there is no place for science, art, literature, love, self-expression. In this totalitarian dystopia, it's not human rights that are lost, but humanity itself.

### Characters

- **John the Savage:** child of Linda and Thomas, born and raised in the Reservation. Gets bullied in the Reservation for being an "outsider" and because his mom has "had" every man in town. His worldview is based on the works of Shakespeare and traditions he picked up from the tribe he grew up in. He does not fit in anywhere. "He is himself a Shakespearean character in a world where any poetry that does not sell a product is prohibited." His name refers to religion (being baptised).
- **Henry Foster:** \\(\alpha^+\\) male, works at the Hatchery. Model citizen of the World State.
- **Fanny Crowne:** \\(\beta^-\\) female, works at the Hatchery. Model citizen of the World State.
- **Bernard Marx:** \\(\alpha^+\\) male, works at the Hatchery. Outcast from society because of his inferior physique (rumoured to be caused by a mistake during production) and unorthodox ideas about relationships, freedom and individuality. He is frustrated by the World State, not because of any real ideological reason, but more his frustration of not fitting in (but wanting to). His name refers to marxism (critique of capitalism).
- **Helmholtz Watson:** \\(\alpha^+\\) male, writes for hypnopaedia (sleep) conditioning. His frustration with the World State (on a ideological level) stem from intellectual boredom and lack of meaning. He looks down at Bernard for his petty boasting and moaning. His name means "thinker".
- **Lenina Crowne:** \\(\beta^+\\) female, works at the Hatchery. There's a constant struggle between her as a person, and her as a conditioned World State citizen; on the one hand she entertains unorthodox ideas like monogamy. She feels attracted to Bernard and John, both unconventional men in the World State. But she also rejects other "anti-social" behaviours when presented them by Bernard, and cannot understand Bernard or John. She also illustrates why strong emotions such as love cause instability in the World State. Her name refers to Lenin (yay, communism again!)
- **Thomas:** Director of the Hatchery. A very orthodox citizen, be it for the fact he accidentally had a baby with Linda in Malpais and then lost her there and left without her.
- **Linda:** Name means "beautiful", but only ugly things happen to her (and her appearance).
- **Mustapha Mond:** gave up on being a scientist to become World Controller. Has a nuanced understanding of literature, science and history, and uses it to defend the values of the World State. Reads the Bible and classical literature, but also censors new, independent ideas. Believes stability and happiness are the ultimate goal for humanity, even if it means we'd have to sacrifice creativity, literature, science, art, and individuality.

### Themes

- **Mass production & consumption:** see Worldbuilding.
- **Totalitarianism:** see Worldbuilding.
- **Enforced utilitarianism:** the philosophy of maximizing happiness no matter the means. (Anything that makes you sad is automatically bad, anything that makes you happy is good.) In Brave New World, people are happy because they are conditioned to love their lives. They all suffer from "deliberately incuded attachment disorder" and hypersexuality as a result of conditioning and child abuse--but it makes them happy.
- **Individuality, Happiness and Freedom/Truth:** in the book, happiness and freedom are presented as opposites. Would you rather be unhappy and free than happy and enslaved for the rest of your life? The prevelant use of soma throughout the story is a form of "willful self-delusion" the characters use to escape the truth of the situations they are in. Truth hurts, so the World State eliminated it. Scientific truth, as well as human truths (love, friendship, family). Because an individual search for truth is a danger to social stability as a whole.
- **Power of knowledge:** see Worldbuilding.

### Symbols

- **Ford Model T:** symbolizes industry and mass production<!-- (because it's the first mass-produced car in the US)--><!-- and also functions as a way to ridicule religion-->.
- **Shakespeare:** symbolizes deep feelings, emotions, high art, knowledge and science. The title _Brave New World_ is also derived from a Shakespeare play ("The Tempest").

## The Great Gatsby

### Plot summary

- Gatsby and Daisy meet and fall in love in Louisville before Gatsby leaves for the army.
- Daisy waits for Gatsby to return from the war, but he doesn't. She marries Tom instead.
- Tom starts cheating with Myrtle.
- George suspects it, but doesn't know who his wife is cheating with.
- Gatsby returns and lives an extravagant lifestyle to impress Daisy.
- Nick moves from the West to the New York (East) and is now neighbours with Gatsby.
- Tom and Daisy introduce Nick to Jordan and they start a relationship.
- Nick and Jordan meet Gatsby at one of his Saturday parties.
- Gatsby asks Jordan to ask Nick to ask Daisy to have a cup of tea together.
- Nick invites both Gatsby and Daisy to his house. Daisy doesn't know Gatsby is coming.
- Gatsby and Daisy begin an affair.
- Tom and Daisy have a fancy dinner. Daisy invites Gatsby, and Tom gets suspicious.
- Tom tells everyone Gatsby is a criminal, and that his business is merely a front for a criminal operation for bootlegging alcohol (the story takes place during the Prohibition, a period in which alcohol was banned by the federal government).
- Gatsby loses his temper, causing Daisy to lose faith in him.
- Gatsby and Daisy go home together (why?). Gatsby lets Daisy drive and she runs over Myrtle.
- Nick, Jordan, and Tom find out about the accident on their way home.
- Nick learns from Gatsby that he intends to take the blame.
- Tom tells George that Gatsby killed his wife.
- George thinks Gatsby must have been the one his wife was cheating with.
- George shoots Gatsby by the pool and then commits suicide.
- The media concludes the murder must have been about Gatsby's criminal background.
- Nick has a small funeral for Gatsby.
- Nick breaks up with Jordan and moves West again, because he does not want to be reminded of Gatsby anymore.

### Characters

- **Nick Carraway:** from the East, where his family has "old money", moves West to learn about bond business. He knows Tom from college (Yale) and thus has connections with the more wealthy people in New York. Nick narrates the story.
- **Gatsby:** neighbours with Nick. In love with Daisy, but missed out on marrying her. Now attempts to get back in touch with her (which is why he bought the house). Made his money with his own business ("new money"), which turns out to be a front for a criminal organisation.
- **Tom Buchanan:** comes from a wealthy family (old money). Daisy's husband. Great football player, reached his peak at around age 21; the rest of his life would be an "anti-climax". This makes him a restless character.
- **Daisy:** love interest of Gatsby, cousin of Nick, married to Tom.
- **Jordan Baker:** Nick's girlfriend.
- **Myrtle Wilson:** misstress of Tom.
- **George Wilson:** husband of Myrtle, owner of tank station. Murders Gatsby in the end.

### Themes

- **The American Dream:** the American Dream is the idea that _anyone_, given enough work, can become succesfull (aka rich) in America. In the story, we can see this in literal wealth: "old money" (aka inheriting wealth) and "new money" (aka people who earned it through hard work), and the divide between East and West. Furthermore, Gatsby's quest for Daisy is the personification of the American Dream. <!--Problems like systemic racism and sexism, misogyny, and income inequality can prevent marginalized groups from obtaining the American Dream, and so did the class hierachy between "old" and "new" money prevent Gatsby from building a life with Daisy.-->

- **Corruption**: the story portrays the corruption of the American Dream. Gatsby's fortune turned out not to be earned through hard word, but by crime. Additionally, the focus (of the ultra rich) seems to be putting wealth on display; it's is no longer building an ideal life with an ideal family, but "getting rich".

- **Honesty & Betrayal:** there's a lot of lying in the story. Gatsby's past; criminality; affairs; secrets.

### Symbols

- **West:** working in businesses for money. It also represents a less wealthy segment of the population.
- **East:** making money with money, through investing, trading, and complicated financial instruments such as bonds. It represents wealth.
- **Green light:** symbolizes Gatsby's love for Daisy, and his hopes for the future. Daisy is, just like the green light at the end of her dock, something he can reach toward, but never quite reaches. His love for Daisy can be a metaphor for the American Dream, and thus the green light can be a metaphor for how immigrants see the US.
- **Dr. TJ Eckleburg's faded eyes:** the eyes on the billboard can represent God staring down at and "judging American society as a moral wasteland." The weathering can represent the breakdown of religious institutions, and the secularisation of society. The weathered advert can also represent the "superficiality of wealth and fame"; Gatsby seemed to have _everything_, but in the end he only has one friend who bothered to call (Nick).

### Discussion questions

- **What is the significance of the title "The Great Gatsby"? How does it reflect the themes and characters in the story?**

### Plot summary

Story 1:

- Monkey king born of rock.
- Beats the evil tiger spirit and establishes the kingdom.
- Masters Kung-Fu: fist-like-lightning, thunderous foot, heavenly senses, cloud-as-steed. This makes him immortal.
- He wants to go to a dinner party for gods and waits in line for _eternity_.
- He was refused entry because he didn't have shoes.
- He is embarrased and kills all the other gods.
- He goes back home, but he now cannot stop to notice the monkey smell.

Story 2:

- Jin Wan arrives at his new school. People mispronounce his name and mistakenly think he is from China, even tho he is from San Francisco.
- He gets stereotyped, and evades the other Asian kid in his class to prevent being bullied.
- Some kid called Peter "befriends" Jin, but actually he is just bullying him too.
- He leaves and never comes back.
- Wei-Chen arrives, he gets the same treatment Jin did when he arrived.
- At first, Jin doesn't want to be friends.
- They become best friends anyway (because Jin liked Wei-Chen's robot).

Story 3:

- Jin gets beat up by _someone_(?)
- Jin thinks about it in bed, and needs to the "The Truth" to Wei-Chen(?)
- He decided he wants to become an American.
- In order to do so, he chooses an new name; Danny. His looks also change to that of a blonde, white boy. This could be metaphorical.  
(aka it's a change of perspective, did not actually happen; he is now seen like this by the narrater).
- Danny is making homework with a girl (probably his crush). They are flirting, but at a _crucial_ moment, the arrival Chin-Kee, his cousing, interrupts them.
- Chin-Kee objectifies Danny's crush and violates her personal space.

In conclusion, the entire story is full of time jumps and it makes no sense whatsoever.

### Themes

- **Stereotypes:** Chin-Kee is a deliberately exaggerated charicature of Chinese people, in appearance, but also speech and manners. The goal is making fun of the stereotype itself. We also see some stereotypical ideas about Asians (eating dogs, married away at 13 etc) referenced in the second story.
- **Assimilation:** Jin does not fit in in American high school. At the end of the story, he decides he wants to become more American and changes his name, appearance and behaviour to be more like stereotypical American boys. This is an example of assimilation (adjusting to other cultures).
- **Self-acceptance:** in both stories, the main characters struggle with their identity. The Monkey King cannot be content with being a monkey after being rejected for it. Jin similarly changes his entire identity to become more American.
- **Racism:** featured throughout the stories; the Monkey King is not let in for being a monkey. Jin and Wei-Chen are both stereotyped, made fun of and bullied. <!--However, we can also see Chin-Kee's behaviour as a form of racism.-->

## Symbolism

- The first story is a metaphor for Jin's story. Like Jin, the Monkey King is also not accepted and cannot fit in. They are both met with rejection and bullying.

## Discussion questions

- **Why do you think the author decided to write American Born Chinese in the form of
a graphic novel? What is its effect?** By telling the story via a graphic novel, it's way easier for the author to show and ridicule stereotypes and charicatures visually, which would not have been possible had the story been a novel.
