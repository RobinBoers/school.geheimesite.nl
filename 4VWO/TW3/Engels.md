## History of the English language

### Proto English

English doesn't exist yet. A few languages that are spoken in the area (by the Britons) are:

- Celtic
- (Short and simple) Latin borrows

The latin words are brought in by the Romans after they invade Britannia.

### Old English

- **Anglo-Saxon** people come:
    - forms an germanic base for the language
    - similar to modern Frissian

- Migrations: **Celtic** speaking people move north

- **Viking invasions**:
    - contribute the sk-sounds
      (skirt, skin etc.)
    - and they/them/their

Not much is written down yet. Most of it is told in oral tradition.

Notable literature from this period: *Beowulf*.

### Middle English

These languages get spoken:

- **Anglo-Norman (French)**: spoken by the nobility in for example the government and law.
- **English**: spoken by the people in local communities.
- **Latin**: used (not spoken) in education and the church by mostly the clergy. Used for science and history.
- **Celtic**: on the outskirts.

Due to intermarriage between the orders of society (people, nobility and clergy) people raise their kids bilingual. This means English is becomes used more widespread.

Notable literature from this period: *The Canterbury Tales* by Geoffrey Chaucer.

### Early modern English

After the printing press is invented a lot of things are written down. Due to this the English language spreads quickly. This area has:

- the first English dictionaries
- the first English grammar books
- the first English bible (the King James bible)

This period also includes the:

- Renaissance
- Englightment

Notable literature from this period: *William Shakespeare*.

## Beowulf

### Summary

People are feasting in Herot. Then Grendel, who lives in a swamp and is a spawn of Cain, comes to Herot at night and kills a few men. He repeats this every night for 12 years straight. The Geats try everything but can't get rid of him.

Then the strongest warrior of the Geats, Beowulf (who is also king Hrothgar's nephew) comes to help them. He and 14 of his strongest warriors enter a ship to save the Danes.

When they arrive at Herot Beowulf leaves a few of his warriors outside. Then he and the rest take of their weapons and enter Herot to speak with king Hrothgar. Beowulf brags about his experience and strength and asks king Hrothgar for permission to fight Grendel all by himself.

> Potential test question: why does he want to do this?  
> A: possible because he wants the glory all for himself.

They continue to eat a good meal and Beowulf brags more. Unferth says Beowulf is naive and weak. He tells a story about how Beowulf and Brecca had a swimming compition and Beowulf lost. He is clearly jeaous of Beowulf and tries to intimidate him. Beowulf replies by telling Unferth he's drunk (he is) and that his story is incorrect. Beowulf did indeed lose, but that's because he had to fight underwater monsters (and won), and Brecca did not. Then Beowulf exposes that Unferth killed his own brothers.

In the night Grendel arrives again. He kills one of the Geat warriors and then tries to kill Beowulf. Beowulf however, is actually awake and fights Grndel with his bare hands. 

> Note: there is a bit of foreshadowing in this fragment ("his last human supper"). Foreshadowing means the writer already let's you know what is going to happen later. In this case Grendel is going to die.

His thirdteen other warriors wake up and try to hurt Grendel, but his skin is bewitched, so they can't hurt him with their swords. Then Beowulf rips off Grendels arm and Grendel escapes to his swamp where he bleeds to dead. 

> Note: During this fight the writer emphasizes that Herot is very strong, and even tho there is a fierce battle going on inside, the walls keep standing. This both shows how brutal the battle was and how great Herot is.

Beowulf hangs Grendels arm from the ceiling of Herot. The Geats follow the blood tracks to Grendels swamp and find out he died alone in a lake, where "hell opened up to receive him".

> Fun fact: later the story says he's just lying there on the bottom of the lake, which is a bit of a contradiction with "hell opening up to receive him".

> Here follows a shitty sequel to the first part of the story:

Grendels mom is not happy that Beowulf killed her son. So, she goes to Herot and murders Hrothgar's best friend. She also takes Grendel's arm with her.

Beowulf is going to save the day again.
