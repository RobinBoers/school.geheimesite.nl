Presentatie voor Engels over comedy, in specifiek over Mr. Bean.

## Introducion

The first Mr. Bean series was released on January 1st, 1990. It featured a total of 15 episodes, starring, you guessed it, Mr. Bean. In 1997 a full feature film appeared on the big screen with a sequel, along with a cartoon series, following 2007, a good 17 years after Mr. Bean was introduced to the public.

## Summary

Mr Bean is a comedy show and film series in which the main character, called Mr bean, does normal, everyday tasks and activities in his own, unconventional and silly ways.

## Examples

### Example 1: clumsyness

A running theme with Mr. Bean jokes seems to be the clumsyness. Most of the time he is just akwardly stumbling around without a clue about what he's doing. Some examples are him going to the hairdressers, him in the smimming pool and when he lost the doorknob when trying to paint his room.

### Example 2: childishness

Another common theme in Mr. Bean is his childish behavoir. Think about the time he tries to use the child section of the swimming pool, or his famous teddy.

### Example 3: stupidity

And not to forget: most of the time Mr. Bean is just doing stupid things. For example when he gets his hand stuck in a tea pot, when he tries to paint his appartment using a paint bomb or when he drives his car while ontop of it.

## Conclusion

I think we can safely conclude Mr. Bean is a fun and original show that certainly belongs to the classics of comedy. It is fun for a wide range of audiences and can be viewed on YouTube, making it even more accesible. It has also led to a whole lot of funny compilations and memes that we can all enjoy.
