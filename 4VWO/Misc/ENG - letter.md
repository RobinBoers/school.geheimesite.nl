Hi Frederico,

I'm writing to you because I developed a product at my job that I thought you might appreciate. No, this is not an ad (well it kinda is but you get the point), because it is completely free. I just felt you might be interested.

Basically, we created an app to easily and securely exchange sensitive information. It's similar to WeTransfer and supports both files and plain-text secrets (a secret is the computer science term for an encrypted message btw). We called it Sharefox, and the beta-version is available at https://sharefox.eu if you'd like to try it.

Sharefox uses, unlike WeTransfer, end-to-end encryption. That's computer nerd language for: nobody can access the data except the sender and receiver. WeTransfer does advertise "military-grade encryption", but that's a well known markteting term for basic HTTPS websites; allmost every semi-professional website uses SSL (the lil padlock in the top left corner of the screen) these days.

We mostly built it because we needed it ourselfves, but decided it might be worth-while to develop it into a real product. It basically works like this: you enter the sensitive information (either a file or text), and once you click send it generates a secure link for you. You can then share that link with the receipient, who can download the files using the link. By default the link is only valid for a week and can only be used once. 

The advantage of using Sharefox over sending the file in an end-to-end encrypted chat (like Whatsapp) is that Sharefox links can only be used once and expire after a set amount of time. This means that if anyone ever breaks into the chat or messages are leaked, the sensitive documents/information is not exposed.

I know I said Sharefox was completely free at the beginning of this email, but servers are expensive. That's why we have a pro-plan with a lot more features. The two most important ones are support for files (the free plan only allows you to share text) and custom branding. Some people get confused over the branding, but it's actually quite simple. If you share a link using the free plan it will show the Sharefox logo and colors (and a huge add at the bottom of the page). If you pay for the pro plan you get to upload your own logo, set your own colors, and the ad disappears. This way the link looks way more professional and trustworthy to your clients.

Anyway, now that I did my elevator pitch, are you interested? I figured this might be handy for your ~~illegal drugs business~~ legal company since you handle a lot of sensitive information.

I hope I convinced you to use Sharefox. 
See you later,

Robin
